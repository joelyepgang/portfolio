							<h4>Description</h4>
							
							<p>
								
										technofutur is an accredited training center focused on training. As a student through Mr faulkner we were there to perform four training which in the end proved to be very beneficial for me.
										Let's start with java, this material seen in class although explained by our teachers gave me a lot of shadow in my mind. The first days of training started very slowly to put everyone in the bath and to follow each student.the goal being to revisit the material seen in course but this time through various exercises to realize with our trainer and later correct them together then explain. this happened in several phases, a theoretical study that revisited the big object-oriented concept (variable declaration, inheritance, class, abstract class, etc.) and then followed the completion phase of a complex project on the last day. which brought together all the elements to study the last four days of the training.
										Then came the csharp training which is similar to the java training except for the teachers in the last one. It has a lot more emphasis on the mvc and the way to see it and edit it. Another remark was that of the completely different variable declarations of the java.
										 the training will be only a complement on the perfect realization of a structuring mvc. Thus, through the latter, it was a question of me understanding the model, view and control arrangement and then using it.

										the training uml that in it was the one that opened my eyes on a new perspective of formation which is none other than that of analyst. this training in connection with our third year database course was more focused on the case study in a given situation and so it was a question of looking at possible possibility for different senario.
										All these training courses have been of great help to me in my curcus and some of them still follow me today.
